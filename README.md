# Patatap Clone Project #
*Completed as a part of the online course The Web Developer Bootcamp in Udemy*

***
This is one of the project completed during the front end web development section of the course ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

This HTML project is something very similar to the website [Patatap](https://www.patatap.com/). Basically, whenever an alphabetical key is pressed the browser will play a sound assigned to that key and render some animation on the screen. Some non-alphabetical keys such as shift and ctrl keys are also supported.

The dependencies of this project include [j-Query](https://jquery.com/), [PaperJS](http://paperjs.org/), [HowlerJS](https://howlerjs.com/). The project also uses some sound files which are available online at the [github](https://github.com/jonobr1/Neuronal-Synchrony/tree/master/assets/D) for Patatap.

Running the index.html will execute the project. Ensure the assets folder is placed  in the same directory.
